X (Twitter) — App Instruction Card (DroidRun)

What X is:
X is a fast feed-based app for short posts (“tweets”), replies, reposts/retweets, likes, DMs, and search/discovery. Most tasks are easiest via Search.

Core navigation (quick map)

Home = main feed

Search (🔍) = accounts, keywords, hashtags, trends

Notifications (🔔) = mentions + replies

Messages (✉️) = DMs

Profile / avatar = your profile + settings

Post button (+ / feather / “Post”) = create tweet

✅ Reliable pattern: Search → open profile/post → interact (follow/like/reply/DM)

Common actions (clean steps)

Search & open a profile

Tap Search (🔍)

Type username / name

Switch to People tab if available

Tap profile → verify handle @...

Follow / Unfollow

On profile: tap Follow

If already following: tap Following → Unfollow (confirm)

Open latest tweet from a profile

Open profile

First tweet in timeline is usually latest

Tap it to open details + replies

Like / Reply / Repost

❤️ Like = tap heart

💬 Reply = tap reply icon → type → Post

🔁 Repost = tap repost → choose Repost or Quote

Send a DM

Open profile

Tap Message (if available)

Type → Send

⚠️ If Message isn’t available, user likely blocks DMs or requires following.

Bookmark

Open tweet → tap Share → Bookmark
(or ••• → Bookmark, depending on UI)

Copy link

Tweet → Share → Copy link

Popups & interruptions (how to handle)

“Turn on notifications” → Not now

“Sign in to continue” → stop unless login credentials are available

“Rate limit / Something went wrong” → back out, retry once, then stop

Scrolling rules (don’t mess it up)

Feed is infinite: use short scrolls

Opening replies can trap you: use Back to return to profile/feed

If you lose context: Search again (reset path)

Common failure modes

Wrong profile opened → fix by verifying exact @handle

Tabs missing (People/Latest) → still works; just use search results list carefully

DM button missing → don’t force it; do follow/reply instead

Safety / behavior rules

Don’t mass-like or mass-follow quickly (looks bot-like, triggers limits)

Don’t post tweets unless explicitly asked

Avoid engaging with ads/sponsored posts unless requested

Fast recipes

Follow someone: Search → People → open profile → Follow

Reply to latest tweet: Search → profile → open top tweet → Reply → Post

Get tweets on a topic: Search keyword → switch to Latest → open relevant tweet
