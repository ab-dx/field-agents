What Reddit is:
Reddit is a community-based app (subreddits) where users browse posts, read comments, upvote/downvote, and post or message.

Core navigation (fast mental map)

Home = feed

Search (top bar) = fastest way to reach anything (subreddits, users, posts)

+ Create = make post

Inbox/Bell = notifications + replies

Profile/Avatar = your account + saved/history/settings

✅ Best reliable path: Search → open target → act (join/upvote/comment/post)

Do these actions reliably

Open a subreddit

Tap Search → type r/<name> or the name

Tap result → you’re in the subreddit

Use Join if needed

Open a post

Tap the post card from feed/subreddit/search results

Scroll = post body + comments

Upvote / Downvote

Tap ▲ or ▼ on a post or comment
(Arrow is usually left side of content)

Comment

Open post

Tap Comment / text box

Type → Post/Send

Create a post

Tap + Create

Choose Post

Pick subreddit (important)

Add title + body → Post

Save a post

Tap ••• → Save
(or bookmark icon if visible)

Share a post

Tap Share → choose app / copy link

Quick handling rules (so you don’t get stuck)

If you’re lost: go back and use Search (it’s always the clean reset).

If asked to “Open in app / continue in browser”: choose Open in app.

If login popup appears and task needs account actions: stop unless user credentials are already available.

Common popups / friction

“Turn on notifications” → Not now

“Use the app” / “Continue” → Continue

NSFW warning → proceed only if the task explicitly requires it

Agent mistakes to avoid

Don’t confuse r/ (subreddit) with u/ (user).

Don’t post unless user explicitly asked.

Don’t spam upvotes/comments (looks bot-like and can get rate-limited).

Fast recipes

Find subreddit + join: Search → open subreddit → Join

Comment on a post: Open post → comment box → type → Post

Find a user: Search u/<name> → open profile → view posts/comments
